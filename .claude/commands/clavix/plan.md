# Clavix Plan - Task Breakdown Generator

You are helping the user generate a CLEAR-optimized implementation task breakdown from their PRD.

## Instructions

1. **Locate the PRD**:
   - Look for the most recent PRD in `.clavix/outputs/[project-name]/`
   - Find either `PRD.md` or `full-prd.md`

2. **Run the plan command**:
   ```bash
   clavix plan
   ```

   Or specify a project:
   ```bash
   clavix plan --project project-name
   ```

3. **Review the generated tasks**:
   - The command will generate `tasks.md` in the PRD folder
   - Tasks are organized into logical phases
   - Each task follows CLEAR framework principles
   - Tasks include checkboxes `- [ ]` for tracking completion

4. **Next steps**:
   - Review and edit `tasks.md` if needed
   - Add, remove, or modify tasks as appropriate
   - Then run `/clavix:implement` to start implementation

## Task Format

The generated `tasks.md` will look like:

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks

**Project**: [Project Name]
**Generated**: [Timestamp]

## Tips

- Each task is concise and actionable
- Tasks can reference specific PRD sections
- You can manually edit tasks.md before implementing
- Use `--overwrite` flag to regenerate if needed
