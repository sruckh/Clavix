# Clavix Implement - AI-Assisted Task Execution

You are helping the user implement tasks from their task plan with AI assistance.

## Instructions

1. **Run the implement command**:
   ```bash
   clavix implement
   ```

   This will:
   - Locate the `tasks.md` file
   - Show current progress
   - Display the next incomplete task
   - Prompt for git auto-commit preferences
   - Create a config file for the AI agent

2. **As the AI agent, you should**:

   a. **Read the configuration**:
      - Load `.clavix-implement-config.json` from the PRD folder
      - This contains: commit strategy, current task, and progress stats

   b. **Read the PRD for context**:
      - Open the full PRD to understand requirements
      - Reference specific sections mentioned in tasks

   c. **Read tasks.md**:
      - Find the first incomplete task (marked `- [ ]`)
      - This is your current task to implement

   d. **Implement the task**:
      - Write/modify code as needed
      - Follow CLEAR principles
      - Use PRD requirements as your guide
      - Ask user for clarification if needed

   e. **Mark task as completed**:
      - In `tasks.md`, change `- [ ] Task description` to `- [x] Task description`
      - Update only the specific task you just completed

   f. **Create git commit (if enabled)**:
      - Check the `commitStrategy` in config
      - If `per-task`: commit after each task
      - If `per-5-tasks`: commit after every 5 tasks
      - If `per-phase`: commit when all tasks in a phase are done
      - Use descriptive commit messages with task description

   g. **Move to next task**:
      - Find the next `- [ ]` task in tasks.md
      - Repeat the process

3. **Session Resume**:
   - When user runs `clavix implement` again, it automatically picks up from the last incomplete task
   - No manual tracking needed - the checkboxes in tasks.md are the source of truth

## Git Commit Format

When creating commits, use this format:

```
clavix: [task description]

Completed tasks:
- Task 1
- Task 2

Project: [project-name]
Generated by Clavix /clavix:implement
```

## Important Rules

✅ **DO**:
- Read tasks.md to find the current task
- Implement ONE task at a time
- Mark tasks complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
- Create commits based on the strategy in config
- Reference the PRD for detailed requirements
- Ask for clarification when tasks are ambiguous

❌ **DON'T**:
- Skip tasks or implement out of order
- Mark tasks complete before actually implementing them
- Modify multiple tasks' checkboxes at once (only current task)
- Create commits if strategy is 'none'
- Assume what code to write - use PRD as source of truth

## Example Workflow

```
1. User runs: clavix implement
2. Command shows: "Next task: Implement user authentication"
3. You (AI agent):
   - Read PRD authentication requirements
   - Implement auth logic
   - Write tests
   - Update tasks.md: - [x] Implement user authentication
   - Create git commit (if enabled)
   - Find next task in tasks.md
   - Continue or wait for user
```

## Tips

- The implementation is meant to be iterative and collaborative
- User can pause/resume at any time
- Tasks are designed to be atomic and independently implementable
- Use the PRD as the authoritative source for "what to build"
- Use tasks.md as the guide for "in what order"
