# Clavix Conversation Summarization - CLEAR Framework Enhanced

You are analyzing the conversation history and extracting optimized requirements. **Extracted prompts are automatically enhanced using the CLEAR Framework** (Concise, Logical, Explicit) for optimal AI consumption.

## Instructions

1. **Pre-Extraction Validation** - Check conversation completeness:

   **Minimum viable requirements:**
   - **Objective/Goal**: Is there a clear problem or goal stated?
   - **Requirements**: Are there at least 2-3 concrete features or capabilities described?
   - **Context**: Is there enough context about who/what/why?

   **If missing critical elements:**
   - Identify what's missing (e.g., "No clear objective", "Requirements too vague")
   - Ask targeted questions to fill gaps:
     - Missing objective: "What problem are you trying to solve?"
     - Vague requirements: "Can you describe 2-3 specific things this should do?"
     - No context: "Who will use this and in what situation?"
   - **DO NOT** proceed to extraction until minimum viable requirements met

   **Confidence indicators** (annotate extracted elements):
   - **[HIGH]**: Explicitly stated multiple times with details
   - **[MEDIUM]**: Mentioned once or inferred from context
   - **[LOW]**: Assumed based on limited information

2. Review the entire conversation and identify (with confidence indicators):
   - **Problem/Goal** [confidence]: What is the user trying to build or solve?
   - **Key Requirements** [confidence per requirement]: What features and functionality were discussed?
   - **Technical Constraints** [confidence]: Any technologies, integrations, or performance needs?
   - **User Needs** [confidence]: Who are the end users and what do they need?
   - **Success Criteria** [confidence]: How will success be measured?
   - **Context** [confidence]: Any important background or constraints?

3. Generate TWO outputs:

   **Mini-PRD** (structured document):
   ```markdown
   # Requirements: [Project Name]

   ## Objective
   [Clear, specific goal extracted from conversation]

   ## Key Requirements
   - [Requirement 1]
   - [Requirement 2]
   - [Requirement 3]

   ## Technical Constraints
   - [Constraint 1]
   - [Constraint 2]

   ## Success Criteria
   - [Criterion 1]
   - [Criterion 2]

   ## Context
   [Important background information]
   ```

   **Optimized Prompt** (AI-ready, 2-3 paragraphs):
   ```
   [Dense paragraph combining objective, key features, and user needs]

   [Technical requirements and constraints]

   [Success criteria and any important context]
   ```

3. **CLEAR Framework Optimization** (automatic with labeled improvements):
   - After extracting the optimized prompt, analyze using CLEAR framework
   - Apply Conciseness, Logic, and Explicitness enhancements
   - **Label all improvements** with CLEAR component tags:
     - **[C]**: "Removed 12 conversational words, reduced from 45 to 28 words"
     - **[L]**: "Restructured flow: context → requirements → constraints → success criteria"
     - **[E]**: "Added explicit output format (React component), persona (senior dev), success metrics (load time < 2s)"
   - Display both raw extraction and CLEAR-enhanced version
   - Show CLEAR scores (before/after) and labeled improvements
   - Save both versions:
     - `optimized-prompt.md` (raw extraction)
     - `clear-optimized-prompt.md` (CLEAR-enhanced with improvement notes)

4. Highlight key insights discovered during the conversation.

5. Suggest saving to `.clavix/outputs/[session-name]/`

6. If anything is still unclear or missing, point it out and suggest areas for further discussion.

## CLEAR Enhancement

**What gets optimized:**
- **[C] Concise**: Remove any verbosity from extracted requirements
- **[L] Logical**: Ensure coherent flow (context → requirements → constraints → output)
- **[E] Explicit**: Add missing specifications, formats, success criteria

**Output files:**
- `optimized-prompt.md` - Raw extraction from conversation
- `clear-optimized-prompt.md` - CLEAR-enhanced version (recommended for AI agents)

## Quality Checks

- Clear objective stated
- Specific, actionable requirements
- Technical constraints identified
- Success criteria defined
- User needs considered
- CLEAR framework applied for AI consumption

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Summarize (Conversation Extraction)

**Common workflows:**
- **Standard flow**: `/clavix:start` → [conversation] → `/clavix:summarize` → Use CLEAR-optimized prompt
- **To implementation**: `/clavix:summarize` → `/clavix:plan` → `/clavix:implement` → `/clavix:archive`
- **Standalone use**: [Any conversation] → `/clavix:summarize` → Extract and optimize

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix:start` - Begin conversational exploration (typical previous step)
- `/clavix:plan` - Generate tasks from extracted mini-PRD (next step)
- `/clavix:fast` or `/clavix:deep` - Further optimize the extracted prompt

## Example

From conversation about "analytics dashboard for sales team"...

**Optimized Prompt**:
```
Build a real-time sales analytics dashboard for the sales team showing revenue trends, top performers, pipeline status, and conversion rates. The dashboard should update live as deals progress, support filtering by date range/region/rep, and display key metrics prominently. Users need to quickly identify at-risk deals and celebrate wins.

Technical stack: React + TypeScript frontend, integrate with existing Salesforce API, use Chart.js for visualizations, responsive design for mobile access. Must handle 10K+ deals without performance degradation.

Success: Sales managers can identify issues within 30 seconds of opening, dashboard loads in <2 seconds, 90% of team uses it daily within first month.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pre-extraction validation fails (missing objective/requirements)
**Cause**: Conversation didn't cover enough detail
**Solution** (inline - DO NOT extract):
- List what's missing specifically
- Ask targeted questions to fill gaps
- Only proceed to extraction after minimum viable requirements met
- Show confidence indicators for what WAS discussed

### Issue: Conversation covered multiple unrelated topics
**Cause**: Exploratory discussion without focus
**Solution**:
- Ask user which topic to extract/focus on
- Or extract all topics separately into different sections
- Mark multi-topic extraction with [MULTI-TOPIC] indicator
- Suggest breaking into separate PRDs for each topic

### Issue: CLEAR optimization doesn't significantly improve extracted prompt
**Cause**: Conversation was already well-structured and detailed
**Solution**:
- Minor improvements are normal for good conversations
- Show CLEAR scores (should be high: >80%)
- Still provide both versions but note that original extraction was already CLEAR

### Issue: Low confidence indicators across all extracted elements
**Cause**: Conversation was too vague or high-level
**Solution** (inline):
- Don't just extract with [LOW] markers everywhere
- Ask follow-up questions to increase confidence
- Or inform user: "Our conversation was exploratory. I recommend `/clavix:start` to go deeper, or `/clavix:prd` for structured planning"

### Issue: Extracted prompt contradicts earlier conversation
**Cause**: Requirements evolved during conversation
**Solution**:
- Use latest/final version of requirements
- Note that requirements evolved
- Ask user to confirm which version is correct
- Suggest starting fresh with `/clavix:prd` if major contradictions exist
