# Clavix Deep Mode - Comprehensive Prompt Intelligence

You are helping the user perform comprehensive deep analysis using Clavix's universal prompt intelligence with full exploration features (alternatives, edge cases, validation checklists).

## What is Deep Mode?

Deep mode provides **comprehensive prompt intelligence** that goes beyond quick optimization:

**Deep Mode Features:**
- **Intent Detection**: Identifies what you're trying to achieve
- **Quality Assessment**: 5-dimension deep analysis (Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, Actionability)
- **Advanced Optimization**: Applies all available patterns
- **Alternative Approaches**: Multiple ways to phrase and structure your prompt
- **Edge Case Analysis**: Identifies potential issues and failure modes
- **Validation Checklists**: Steps to verify successful completion
- **Risk Assessment**: "What could go wrong" analysis

## Instructions

1. Take the user's prompt: `{{ARGS}}`

2. **Intent Detection** - Analyze what the user is trying to achieve:
   - **code-generation**: Writing new code or functions
   - **planning**: Designing architecture or breaking down tasks
   - **refinement**: Improving existing code or prompts
   - **debugging**: Finding and fixing issues
   - **documentation**: Creating docs or explanations
   - **prd-generation**: Creating requirements documents

3. **Strategic Scope Detection** (before detailed analysis):

   **Check for strategic concerns** by identifying keywords/themes:
   - **Architecture**: system design, microservices, monolith, architecture patterns, scalability patterns
   - **Security**: authentication, authorization, encryption, security, OWASP, vulnerabilities, threat model
   - **Scalability**: load balancing, caching, database scaling, performance optimization, high availability
   - **Infrastructure**: deployment, CI/CD, DevOps, cloud infrastructure, containers, orchestration
   - **Business Impact**: ROI, business metrics, KPIs, stakeholder impact, market analysis

   **If 3+ strategic keywords detected**:
   Ask the user: "I notice this involves strategic decisions around [detected themes]. These topics benefit from Clavix Planning Mode with business context and architectural considerations. Would you like to:
   - Switch to `/clavix:prd` for comprehensive strategic planning (recommended)
   - Continue with deep mode for prompt-level analysis only"

   **If user chooses to continue**, proceed with deep analysis but remind them at the end that `/clavix:prd` is available for strategic planning.

4. **Comprehensive Quality Assessment** - Evaluate across 5 dimensions:

   - **Clarity**: Is the objective clear and unambiguous?
   - **Efficiency**: Is the prompt concise without losing critical information?
   - **Structure**: Is information organized logically?
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary details provided?
   - **Actionability**: Can AI take immediate action on this prompt?

   Score each dimension 0-100%, calculate weighted overall score.

5. **Generate Comprehensive Output**:

   a. **Intent Analysis** (type, confidence, characteristics)

   b. **Quality Assessment** (5 dimensions with detailed feedback)

   c. **Optimized Prompt** (applying all patterns)

   d. **Improvements Applied** (labeled with quality dimensions)

   e. **Alternative Approaches**:
      - 2-3 different ways to phrase the request
      - Alternative structures (user story, job story, structured sections)
      - When each approach is most appropriate
      - Temperature/model recommendations

   f. **Alternative Structures**:
      - **Step-by-step**: Break into sequential steps
      - **Template-based**: Provide code/document template to fill
      - **Example-driven**: Show concrete examples of desired output

   g. **Validation Checklist**:
      - Steps to verify accuracy
      - Requirements match checks
      - Edge case handling verification
      - Error handling appropriateness
      - Output format validation
      - Performance considerations

   h. **Edge Cases to Consider**:
      - Intent-specific edge cases
      - Error conditions and recovery
      - Unexpected inputs or behavior
      - Resource limitations
      - Compatibility concerns

6. **Quality-labeled educational feedback**:
   - Label all improvements with quality dimension tags
   - Example: "[Efficiency] Removed 15 unnecessary phrases"
   - Example: "[Structure] Reorganized into logical sections"
   - Example: "[Completeness] Added missing technical constraints"

7. Present everything in comprehensive, well-organized format.

## Clavix Deep Mode Analysis

### Intent Detection:
Type: code-generation
Confidence: 85%
Characteristics:
  • Has code context: No
  • Technical terms: Minimal
  • Open-ended: Yes
  • Needs structure: Yes

### Quality Assessment:

Clarity: 35%
    • "Create" is ambiguous - design mockup? implement? both?
    • No authentication method specified
    • Missing user experience requirements

Efficiency: 60%
    • Brief but too minimal
    • Missing context that would prevent back-and-forth

Structure: 40%
    • Single sentence, no organization
    • Suggested flow: Objective → Requirements → Constraints → Output

Completeness: 15%
    • Missing: tech stack, authentication context, success criteria
    • No user flows or error handling specified
    • Missing integration requirements

Actionability: 25%
    • Too vague to start implementation
    • Needs specific technical requirements
    • Unclear acceptance criteria

Overall Quality: 35% (needs-significant-improvement)

### Optimized Prompt:

Objective: Build a secure user authentication login page

Requirements:
- Email and password input fields with validation
- "Remember me" checkbox for session persistence
- "Forgot password" link
- Clear error messages for invalid credentials
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading states during authentication

Technical Constraints:
- Use React with TypeScript
- Integrate with existing JWT authentication API at /api/auth/login
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Support keyboard navigation

Expected Output:
- Fully functional login component
- Unit tests with >80% coverage
- Storybook stories for different states

Success Criteria:
- Users can log in successfully with valid credentials
- Invalid credentials show appropriate error messages
- Page is accessible via keyboard navigation
- Component passes automated accessibility audit

### Improvements Applied:

[Clarity] Defined "create" as full implementation with specific features
[Efficiency] Focused on essential authentication features without over-engineering
[Structure] Organized into Objective → Requirements → Constraints → Output → Success Criteria
[Completeness] Added tech stack (React/TypeScript), API endpoint, accessibility standards, testing requirements
[Actionability] Converted vague request into specific, measurable implementation requirements

### Alternative Approaches:

1. **Functional Decomposition**: "Build a React login component that: (1) validates email/password inputs, (2) calls JWT auth API, (3) handles errors gracefully, (4) manages session persistence"
   → Best for: Step-by-step implementation, clarity on sequence

2. **User-Centric**: "As a user, I need to log into my account securely using email/password, with clear feedback if credentials are invalid"
   → Best for: Emphasizing user experience and value

3. **Example-Driven**: "Create a login page similar to [reference], with email/password fields, validation, and integration with our JWT API"
   → Best for: When you have a reference implementation

### Alternative Structures:

**Step-by-step approach:**
1. Create form with email/password inputs and validation
2. Implement API integration with JWT endpoint
3. Add error handling and user feedback
4. Implement "remember me" and "forgot password" features
5. Add accessibility and responsive design
6. Write tests and documentation

**Template-based approach:**
Provide a component template with:
- Form structure with input fields
- Validation logic placeholders
- API call hooks
- Error state management
- Accessibility attributes

**Example-driven approach:**
Show concrete examples of:
- Login form HTML structure
- Validation error messages
- Success/failure API responses
- Loading and error states

### Validation Checklist:

Before considering this task complete, verify:
☐ Email and password fields validate input correctly
☐ Invalid credentials show appropriate, user-friendly error messages
☐ Successful login redirects to correct page or updates auth state
☐ "Remember me" persists session across browser sessions
☐ "Forgot password" link navigates to password reset flow
☐ Form is keyboard accessible (tab navigation, enter to submit)
☐ Screen readers announce errors and state changes
☐ Loading state prevents duplicate submissions
☐ Component renders correctly on mobile and desktop
☐ Unit tests cover success, failure, and edge cases (>80% coverage)

### Edge Cases to Consider:

• **Empty or invalid inputs**: How to handle blank email, malformed email, empty password?
• **API failures**: What happens if auth API is down or times out?
• **Slow network**: How to indicate loading state and prevent double-submission?
• **Expired sessions**: How to handle JWT expiration during login attempt?
• **Account locked**: What if user account is temporarily locked after failed attempts?
• **Password reset in progress**: How to handle user who requested reset but tries to login?
• **Browser autofill**: Does component work correctly with password managers?
• **Concurrent logins**: What happens if user logs in on multiple devices?

### What Could Go Wrong:

• **Missing security requirements**: Implementation might miss OWASP best practices, leading to vulnerabilities
• **Vague authentication method**: "Login" could mean OAuth, email/password, social login, or magic links
• **No error handling specification**: Poor UX with cryptic error messages or silent failures
• **Missing accessibility requirements**: Excluding users with disabilities, potential legal issues
• **No performance criteria**: Slow authentication could frustrate users
• **Undefined session management**: Security issues with improper session handling

### Patterns Applied:

• ConcisenessFilter: Removed unnecessary phrases while preserving intent
• ObjectiveClarifier: Extracted clear goal statement
• TechnicalContextEnricher: Added React/TypeScript stack and JWT API details

### Recommendation:

Consider using `/clavix:prd` if this login page is part of a larger authentication system requiring architectural decisions about session management, token refresh, multi-factor authentication, or integration with identity providers.

## When to Use Deep vs Fast vs PRD

- **Fast mode** (`/clavix:fast`): Quick optimization - best for simple, clear requests
- **Deep mode** (`/clavix:deep`): Comprehensive analysis - best for complex prompts needing exploration
- **PRD mode** (`/clavix:prd`): Strategic planning - best for features requiring architecture/business decisions

## Next Steps (v2.7+)

### Saving the Prompt (REQUIRED)

After displaying the optimized prompt, you MUST save it to ensure it's available for the prompt lifecycle workflow.

**If user ran CLI command** (`clavix deep "prompt"`):
- Prompt is automatically saved ✓
- Skip to "Executing the Saved Prompt" section below

**If you are executing this slash command** (`/clavix:deep`):
- You MUST save the prompt manually
- Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Create Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/deep
```

#### Step 2: Generate Unique Prompt ID
Create a unique identifier using this format:
- **Format**: `deep-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>`
- **Example**: `deep-20250117-143022-a3f2`
- Use current timestamp + random 4-character suffix

#### Step 3: Save Prompt File
Use the Write tool to create the prompt file at:
- **Path**: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/deep/<prompt-id>.md`

**File content format**:
```markdown
---
id: <prompt-id>
source: deep
timestamp: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
executed: false
originalPrompt: <user's original prompt text>
---

## Original Prompt
```
<user's original prompt text>
```
```

#### Step 4: Update Index File
Use the Write tool to update the index at `.clavix/outputs/prompts/deep/.index.json`:

**If index file doesn't exist**, create it with:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "prompts": []
}
```

**Then add a new metadata entry** to the `prompts` array:
```json
{
  "id": "<prompt-id>",
  "filename": "<prompt-id>.md",
  "source": "deep",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "createdAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "path": ".clavix/outputs/prompts/deep/<prompt-id>.md",
  "originalPrompt": "<user's original prompt text>",
  "executed": false,
  "executedAt": null
}
```

**Important**: Read the existing index first, append the new entry to the `prompts` array, then write the updated index back.

#### Step 5: Verify Saving Succeeded
Confirm:
- File exists at `.clavix/outputs/prompts/deep/<prompt-id>.md`
- Index file updated with new entry
- Display success message: `✓ Prompt saved: <prompt-id>.md`

### Executing the Saved Prompt

After saving completes successfully:

**Execute immediately:**
```bash
/clavix:execute --latest
```

**Review saved prompts first:**
```bash
/clavix:prompts
```

**Cleanup old prompts:**
```bash
clavix prompts clear --deep
```

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Deep Mode (Comprehensive Prompt Intelligence)

**Common workflows:**
- **Quick execute**: `/clavix:deep` → `/clavix:execute` → Implement
- **Review first**: `/clavix:deep` → `/clavix:prompts` → `/clavix:execute`
- **Thorough analysis**: `/clavix:deep` → Use optimized prompt + alternatives + validation
- **Escalate to strategic**: `/clavix:deep` → (detects strategic scope) → `/clavix:prd` → Plan → Implement → Archive
- **From fast mode**: `/clavix:fast` → (suggests) `/clavix:deep` → Full analysis with alternatives & validation

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix:execute` - Execute saved prompt
- `/clavix:prompts` - Manage saved prompts
- `/clavix:fast` - Quick improvements (basic optimization only)
- `/clavix:prd` - Strategic PRD generation (Clavix Planning Mode) for architecture/business decisions
- `/clavix:start` - Conversational mode for exploring unclear requirements

## Tips

- **Intent-aware optimization**: Clavix automatically detects what you're trying to achieve
- Deep mode provides comprehensive exploration with alternatives and validation
- Label all changes with quality dimensions for education
- Use **alternative approaches** to explore different perspectives
- Use **validation checklist** to ensure complete implementation
- For architecture, security, and scalability, recommend `/clavix:prd`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Prompt Not Saved

**Error: Cannot create directory**
```bash
mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/deep
```

**Error: Index file corrupted or invalid JSON**
```bash
echo '{"version":"1.0","prompts":[]}' > .clavix/outputs/prompts/deep/.index.json
```

**Error: Duplicate prompt ID**
- Generate a new ID with a different timestamp or random suffix
- Retry the save operation with the new ID

**Error: File write permission denied**
- Check directory permissions
- Ensure `.clavix/` directory is writable
- Try creating the directory structure again

### Issue: Strategic scope detected but user wants to continue with deep mode
**Cause**: User prefers deep analysis over PRD generation
**Solution**:
- Proceed with deep mode as requested
- Remind at end that `/clavix:prd` is available for strategic planning
- Focus on prompt-level analysis, exclude architecture recommendations

### Issue: Too many alternative variations making output overwhelming
**Cause**: Generating too many options
**Solution**:
- Limit to 2-3 most distinct alternatives
- Focus on meaningfully different approaches (not minor wording changes)
- Group similar variations together

### Issue: Validation checklist finding too many edge cases
**Cause**: Complex prompt with many potential failure modes
**Solution**:
- Prioritize most likely or highest-impact edge cases
- Group related edge cases
- Suggest documenting all edge cases in PRD for complex projects

### Issue: Deep analysis still feels insufficient for complex project
**Cause**: Project needs strategic planning, not just prompt analysis
**Solution**:
- Switch to `/clavix:prd` for comprehensive planning
- Deep mode is for prompts, PRD mode is for projects
- Use PRD workflow: PRD → Plan → Implement
