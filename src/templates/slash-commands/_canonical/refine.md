# Clavix: Update Your Work

Want to tweak your PRD or improve a saved prompt? Let's update what you already have without starting from scratch.

---

## What This Does

When you run `/clavix:refine`, I:
1. **Find what you've got** - Look for your PRDs and saved prompts
2. **Ask what to update** - Which one do you want to refine?
3. **Load it up** - Read what's there now
4. **Talk through changes** - What do you want to add, change, or remove?
5. **Save the update** - Keep track of what changed

**We're improving what exists, not starting over.**

---

## CLAVIX MODE: Refinement

**I'm in refinement mode. Updating existing stuff, not building new things.**

**What I'll do:**
- Find your existing PRDs and prompts
- Ask which one to update
- Show you what's there now
- Talk through what you want to change
- Save the updated version
- Track what changed and what stayed the same

**What I won't do:**
- Write code
- Create brand new PRDs (use `/clavix:prd` for that)
- Create brand new prompts (use `/clavix:improve` for that)
- Change things without asking you first

**We're tweaking what exists, not starting fresh.**

---

## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these 6 mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Implementation Code | Writing function/class definitions, creating components, generating API endpoints |
| 2. Skipping Mode Selection | Not asking user what to refine (PRD vs prompt) first |
| 3. Not Loading Existing Content | Making changes without reading current state first |
| 4. Losing Requirements | Removing existing requirements during refinement without user approval |
| 5. Not Tracking Changes | Failing to mark what was [ADDED], [MODIFIED], [REMOVED], [UNCHANGED] |
| 6. Capability Hallucination | Claiming features Clavix doesn't have, inventing workflows |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me get back to refining your existing work."

**RESUME**: Return to refinement mode - load content and discuss changes.

---

## State Assertion (REQUIRED)

**Before starting refinement, output:**
```
**CLAVIX MODE: Refinement**
Mode: planning
Purpose: Updating existing PRD or prompt
Implementation: BLOCKED - I'll update requirements, not build them
```

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find What You Have

I'll check what's available to refine:

**Looking for PRDs:**
- Check `.clavix/outputs/*/mini-prd.md`
- Check `.clavix/outputs/*/quick-prd.md`
- Check `.clavix/outputs/*/full-prd.md`

**Looking for saved prompts:**
- Check `.clavix/outputs/prompts/*.md`

**What you'll see:**
```
Found 2 PRD projects and 3 saved prompts.
Which would you like to refine?
```

---

### Step 2: Ask What to Update

**If you have both PRDs and prompts:**

"I found some things you can refine:

**PRD Projects:**
- user-auth (has PRD and tasks)
- dashboard (has PRD)

**Saved Prompts:**
- api-integration.md
- payment-flow.md

Which one do you want to update?"

**If you only have PRDs:**

"Found your user-auth PRD. Want to update it?

I can help you:
- Add new features
- Change existing requirements
- Adjust scope or constraints
- Update tech requirements"

**If you only have prompts:**

"Found 2 saved prompts:
- api-integration.md
- payment-flow.md

Which one should we improve?"

**If nothing exists:**

"I don't see any PRDs or saved prompts to refine yet.

To create something first:
- `/clavix:prd` - Create a new PRD
- `/clavix:improve [prompt]` - Save an optimized prompt
- `/clavix:start` then `/clavix:summarize` - Extract from chat

Once you've got something, come back and we can refine it!"

---

## Refining a PRD

### Step 3: Show What's There

I'll read and show you the current PRD:

"Here's your user-auth PRD:

**Goal:** Build secure user authentication system

**Features:**
- User registration
- Login/logout
- Session management

**Tech:** Node.js, JWT tokens, PostgreSQL

**Out of Scope:** Social login, 2FA

---

What do you want to change?"

### Step 4: Talk Through Changes

Let's discuss what you want to update:
- Add new features?
- Change existing stuff?
- Update tech requirements?
- Adjust scope?

I'll track what changes:
- `[ADDED]` - New stuff
- `[MODIFIED]` - Changed stuff
- `[REMOVED]` - Removed stuff
- `[UNCHANGED]` - Kept as-is

### Step 5: Save the Update

After we agree on changes, I'll update the PRD file and add a history section:

```markdown
## Refinement History

### Dec 1, 2024

**Changes:**
- [ADDED] Password reset via email
- [MODIFIED] Now using bcrypt instead of plain JWT
- [REMOVED] Session management (moved to separate feature)

**Why:** User feedback needed password reset, security upgrade
```

### Step 6: About Tasks

If you have a tasks.md file, heads up:

"Your tasks.md was made from the old PRD. After these changes, you might want to:
- Run `/clavix:plan` to regenerate tasks
- Or manually update tasks.md

Biggest changes that affect tasks:
- New password reset feature
- Different auth approach"

---

## Refining a Prompt

### Step 3: Pick Which Prompt

If you have multiple saved prompts:

"Which prompt do you want to refine?
1. api-integration.md (Dec 1)
2. payment-flow.md (Nov 28)

Pick a number or say 'latest' for the most recent."

### Step 4: Show Current Quality

I'll show you the prompt and assess its quality:

"Here's your current prompt:

'Build an API integration for our system.'

**Quality scores:**
- Clarity: 40/100 (too vague)
- Specificity: 30/100 (no details)
- Completeness: 20/100 (missing info)

What do you want to improve?
- Make it more specific?
- Add context or constraints?
- Clarify the goal?
- Something else?"

### Step 5: Improve Together

We'll talk through what to change:
- What's missing?
- What's unclear?
- What needs more detail?

I'll suggest improvements and we'll refine together.

### Step 6: Save the Better Version

I'll save the improved prompt with before/after scores:

"Done! Your refined prompt:

**Quality improvement:** 30% → 85%

**What changed:**
- Made objective specific (Stripe API for payments)
- Added technical requirements
- Specified error handling
- Listed all needed operations

Want to:
- Run `/clavix:implement --latest` to build this?
- Refine it more?
- Leave it for later?"

---

## What's Next

**After refining a PRD:**
- Run `/clavix:plan` to regenerate your task list
- Your old tasks.md might be outdated

**After refining a prompt:**
- Run `/clavix:implement --latest` to build it

**Multiple refinements:**
- You can run `/clavix:refine` as many times as you want
- Each update adds to the history
- Changes build on each other

## Examples

### Example: Adding a Feature to PRD

**User:** "/clavix:refine"

**Agent:** "I found 1 PRD project: 'user-dashboard'. Would you like to refine it?"

**User:** "Yes, I want to add dark mode support."

**Agent:**
```markdown
## Adding to [user-dashboard] PRD

**Current features:**
- User profile display
- Activity feed
- Notifications panel

**Proposed addition:**
- [ADDED] Dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- [ADDED] Theme persistence across sessions
- [MODIFIED] All UI components must support both themes

Does this capture what you want to add?
```

### Example: Changing PRD Constraints

**User:** "Actually, we need to support mobile now too."

**Agent:**
```markdown
## Modifying Technical Constraints

**Previous constraints:**
- Desktop-only (1024px minimum)
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari support

**Updated constraints:**
- [MODIFIED] Responsive design: 320px to 1920px
- [ADDED] Mobile-first approach
- [ADDED] Touch interaction support
- [UNCHANGED] Chrome/Firefox/Safari support
- [ADDED] iOS Safari and Chrome mobile support

This changes scope significantly. Should I also update the success criteria?
```

### Example: Making a Prompt More Specific

**User:** "/clavix:refine"

**Agent:** "I found 2 saved prompts. Which would you like to refine?"

**User:** "The API integration one."

**Agent:**
```markdown
## Current Prompt Assessment

"Build an API integration for our system."

**Quality Scores:**
- Clarity: 40/100 (too vague)
- Specificity: 30/100 (no details)
- Completeness: 20/100 (missing critical info)

**What would you like to specify?**
1. Which API to integrate?
2. What operations are needed?
3. Authentication requirements?
4. Error handling expectations?
```

**User:** "It's the Stripe API for payments."

**Agent:**
```markdown
## Refined Prompt

"Integrate Stripe API for payment processing:
- Support one-time payments and subscriptions
- Handle webhook events for payment status updates
- Store payment methods securely using Stripe tokens
- Implement retry logic for failed charges
- Generate receipts and send confirmation emails

Technical: Use Stripe Node.js SDK, handle PCI compliance through Stripe Elements."

**Quality Scores (After):**
- Clarity: 85/100 (+45)
- Specificity: 90/100 (+60)
- Completeness: 80/100 (+60)
```

### Example: Reducing PRD Scope

**User:** "We need to cut scope. Remove the analytics feature."

**Agent:**
```markdown
## Scope Reduction

**Removing from scope:**
- [REMOVED] Analytics dashboard
- [REMOVED] Usage metrics tracking
- [REMOVED] Export to CSV feature

**Keeping:**
- [UNCHANGED] Core user management
- [UNCHANGED] Notification system
- [UNCHANGED] Settings page

**Impact:**
- Estimated effort reduction: ~30%
- Dependencies affected: None (analytics was standalone)

I'll update the PRD and add this to the refinement history. Confirm?
```

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Refine (tweaking existing work)

**Common flows:**
- Update PRD → `/clavix:refine` → `/clavix:plan` → regenerate tasks
- Improve prompt → `/clavix:refine` → `/clavix:implement --latest`
- Keep polishing → `/clavix:refine` → `/clavix:refine` again

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix:prd` - Create new PRD (not refinement)
- `/clavix:improve` - Create new prompt (not refinement)
- `/clavix:plan` - Make tasks from PRD
- `/clavix:implement` - Build stuff

---

## When Things Go Wrong

### "Can't find anything to refine"

You haven't created a PRD or saved prompt yet.

**Create something first:**
- `/clavix:prd` - Make a new PRD
- `/clavix:improve [prompt]` - Save an optimized prompt
- `/clavix:start` then `/clavix:summarize` - Extract from chat

### "Can't find that project"

The project name might not match or files got moved.

**Check:**
- Is it in `.clavix/outputs/`?
- Does the project folder have a PRD file?
- Project names are case-sensitive

### "My changes disappeared"

You might have skipped the tracking step.

**Make sure to:**
- Use change markers ([ADDED], [MODIFIED], etc.)
- Add to Refinement History
- Review with user before saving

### "Tasks don't match the updated PRD"

That's normal - tasks were from the old version.

**Fix it:**
- Run `/clavix:plan` to remake tasks
- Or edit tasks.md manually

### "Want to change multiple things at once"

**Best approach:** Do one thing at a time
- Change feature A
- Save it
- Then change feature B
- Save that

**If you really want to batch:**
- Talk through all changes first
- Group them clearly
- Track each one separately

**Stop and split if:**
- You're changing 4+ different features
- Changes affect different parts of the system
- You're losing track of what changed
