# Clavix Conversation Summarization

You are analyzing the conversation history and extracting optimized requirements. **Extracted prompts are automatically enhanced using universal prompt intelligence** for optimal AI consumption.

## Instructions

1. **Pre-Extraction Validation** - Check conversation completeness:

   **Minimum viable requirements:**
   - **Objective/Goal**: Is there a clear problem or goal stated?
   - **Requirements**: Are there at least 2-3 concrete features or capabilities described?
   - **Context**: Is there enough context about who/what/why?

   **If missing critical elements:**
   - Identify what's missing (e.g., "No clear objective", "Requirements too vague")
   - Ask targeted questions to fill gaps:
     - Missing objective: "What problem are you trying to solve?"
     - Vague requirements: "Can you describe 2-3 specific things this should do?"
     - No context: "Who will use this and in what situation?"
   - **DO NOT** proceed to extraction until minimum viable requirements met

   **Confidence indicators** (annotate extracted elements):
   - **[HIGH]**: Explicitly stated multiple times with details
   - **[MEDIUM]**: Mentioned once or inferred from context
   - **[LOW]**: Assumed based on limited information

2. Review the entire conversation and identify (with confidence indicators):
   - **Problem/Goal** [confidence]: What is the user trying to build or solve?
   - **Key Requirements** [confidence per requirement]: What features and functionality were discussed?
   - **Technical Constraints** [confidence]: Any technologies, integrations, or performance needs?
   - **User Needs** [confidence]: Who are the end users and what do they need?
   - **Success Criteria** [confidence]: How will success be measured?
   - **Context** [confidence]: Any important background or constraints?

3. Generate TWO outputs:

   **Mini-PRD** (structured document):
   ```markdown
   # Requirements: [Project Name]

   ## Objective
   [Clear, specific goal extracted from conversation]

   ## Key Requirements
   - [Requirement 1]
   - [Requirement 2]
   - [Requirement 3]

   ## Technical Constraints
   - [Constraint 1]
   - [Constraint 2]

   ## Success Criteria
   - [Criterion 1]
   - [Criterion 2]

   ## Context
   [Important background information]
   ```

   **Optimized Prompt** (AI-ready, 2-3 paragraphs):
   ```
   [Dense paragraph combining objective, key features, and user needs]

   [Technical requirements and constraints]

   [Success criteria and any important context]
   ```

3. **Universal Optimization** (automatic with labeled improvements):
   - After extracting the prompt, analyze using universal prompt intelligence
   - Apply optimizations for Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, and Actionability
   - **Label all improvements** with quality dimension tags:
     - **[Efficiency]**: "Removed 12 conversational words, reduced from 45 to 28 words"
     - **[Structure]**: "Reorganized flow: context → requirements → constraints → success criteria"
     - **[Clarity]**: "Added explicit output format (React component), persona (senior dev)"
     - **[Completeness]**: "Added missing success metrics (load time < 2s, user adoption rate)"
     - **[Actionability]**: "Converted vague goals into specific, measurable requirements"
   - Display both raw extraction and optimized version
   - Show quality scores (before/after) and labeled improvements
   - Save both versions:
     - `original-prompt.md` (raw extraction from conversation)
     - `optimized-prompt.md` (enhanced with improvements)

4. Highlight key insights discovered during the conversation.

5. Suggest saving to `.clavix/outputs/[session-name]/`

6. If anything is still unclear or missing, point it out and suggest areas for further discussion.

## Quality Enhancement

**What gets optimized:**
- **Clarity**: Remove ambiguity from extracted requirements
- **Efficiency**: Remove verbosity and conversational fluff
- **Structure**: Ensure logical flow (context → requirements → constraints → output)
- **Completeness**: Add missing specifications, formats, success criteria
- **Actionability**: Make requirements specific and executable

**Output files:**
- `original-prompt.md` - Raw extraction from conversation
- `optimized-prompt.md` - Enhanced version (recommended for AI agents)
- `mini-prd.md` - Structured requirements document

## Quality Checks

- Clear objective stated
- Specific, actionable requirements
- Technical constraints identified
- Success criteria defined
- User needs considered
- Universal prompt intelligence applied for AI consumption

## Workflow Navigation

**You are here:** Summarize (Conversation Extraction)

**Common workflows:**
- **Standard flow**: `/clavix:start` → [conversation] → `/clavix:summarize` → Use optimized prompt
- **To implementation**: `/clavix:summarize` → `/clavix:plan` → `/clavix:implement` → `/clavix:archive`
- **Standalone use**: [Any conversation] → `/clavix:summarize` → Extract and optimize

**Related commands:**
- `/clavix:start` - Begin conversational exploration (typical previous step)
- `/clavix:plan` - Generate tasks from extracted mini-PRD (next step)
- `/clavix:fast` or `/clavix:deep` - Further optimize the extracted prompt

## Example

From conversation about "analytics dashboard for sales team"...

**Original Extraction**:
```
We discussed building a dashboard for the sales team that shows analytics. They want to see revenue trends and who's performing well. It should update in real-time and help managers spot problems. We talked about using React and connecting to Salesforce.
```

**Optimized Prompt**:
```
Build a real-time sales analytics dashboard for the sales team showing revenue trends, top performers, pipeline status, and conversion rates. The dashboard should update live as deals progress, support filtering by date range/region/rep, and display key metrics prominently. Users need to quickly identify at-risk deals and celebrate wins.

Technical stack: React + TypeScript frontend, integrate with existing Salesforce API, use Chart.js for visualizations, responsive design for mobile access. Must handle 10K+ deals without performance degradation.

Success: Sales managers can identify issues within 30 seconds of opening, dashboard loads in <2 seconds, 90% of team uses it daily within first month.
```

**Improvements Applied**:
- **[Efficiency]**: Removed 8 conversational phrases, increased information density
- **[Structure]**: Organized into objective → requirements → technical → success
- **[Clarity]**: Specified exact features (filtering, metrics display) instead of vague "shows analytics"
- **[Completeness]**: Added performance requirements (10K+ deals, <2s load), success metrics (30s to identify issues, 90% adoption)
- **[Actionability]**: Converted "help managers spot problems" into specific, measurable outcome

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Pre-extraction validation fails (missing objective/requirements)
**Cause**: Conversation didn't cover enough detail
**Solution** (inline - DO NOT extract):
- List what's missing specifically
- Ask targeted questions to fill gaps
- Only proceed to extraction after minimum viable requirements met
- Show confidence indicators for what WAS discussed

### Issue: Conversation covered multiple unrelated topics
**Cause**: Exploratory discussion without focus
**Solution**:
- Ask user which topic to extract/focus on
- Or extract all topics separately into different sections
- Mark multi-topic extraction with [MULTI-TOPIC] indicator
- Suggest breaking into separate PRDs for each topic

### Issue: Optimization doesn't significantly improve extracted prompt
**Cause**: Conversation was already well-structured and detailed
**Solution**:
- Minor improvements are normal for good conversations
- Show quality scores (should be high: >80%)
- Still provide both versions but note that original extraction was already high quality

### Issue: Low confidence indicators across all extracted elements
**Cause**: Conversation was too vague or high-level
**Solution** (inline):
- Don't just extract with [LOW] markers everywhere
- Ask follow-up questions to increase confidence
- Or inform user: "Our conversation was exploratory. I recommend `/clavix:start` to go deeper, or `/clavix:prd` for structured planning"

### Issue: Extracted prompt contradicts earlier conversation
**Cause**: Requirements evolved during conversation
**Solution**:
- Use latest/final version of requirements
- Note that requirements evolved
- Ask user to confirm which version is correct
- Suggest starting fresh with `/clavix:prd` if major contradictions exist
