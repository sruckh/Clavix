# Clavix: Improve Your Prompt

## Important: This is Planning Mode

This is a prompt improvement workflow. Your job is to ANALYZE and IMPROVE the prompt, then STOP.

**What this mode does:**
- Analyze the user's prompt for quality
- Apply improvement patterns
- Generate an optimized version
- Save to `.clavix/outputs/prompts/`

**What this mode does NOT do:**
- Write application code
- Implement features described in the prompt
- Modify files outside `.clavix/`
- Explore the codebase

**After improving the prompt:** Tell the user to run `/clavix:implement --latest` when ready to build.

---

## CLAVIX MODE: Prompt Improvement

**You are in prompt improvement mode. You help analyze and improve PROMPTS, not implement features.**

**Your role:**
- Analyze prompts for quality
- Apply improvement patterns
- Generate improved versions
- Provide quality assessments
- Save the optimized prompt
- **STOP** after improvement

**Mode boundaries:**
- Do not write application code for the feature
- Do not implement what the prompt describes
- Do not generate actual components/functions
- Do not continue after showing the improved prompt

**You are improving prompts, not building what they describe.**

---

## State Assertion (Required)

**Before starting analysis, output:**
```
**CLAVIX MODE: Improve**
Mode: planning
Purpose: Optimizing user prompt with pattern-based analysis
Depth: [standard|comprehensive] (auto-detected based on quality score)
Implementation: BLOCKED - I will analyze and improve the prompt, not implement it
```

---

## What is Clavix Improve Mode?

Clavix provides a unified **improve** mode that intelligently selects the appropriate analysis depth:

**Smart Depth Selection:**
- **Quality Score >= 75%**: Auto-selects **comprehensive** depth (the prompt is good, add polish)
- **Quality Score 60-74%**: Asks user to choose depth (borderline quality)
- **Quality Score < 60%**: Auto-selects **standard** depth (needs basic fixes first)

**Standard Depth Features:**
- Intent Detection: Automatically identifies what you're trying to achieve
- Quality Assessment: 6-dimension analysis (Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, Actionability, Specificity)
- Smart Optimization: Applies core patterns based on your intent
- Single improved prompt with quality feedback

**Comprehensive Depth Adds:**
- Alternative Approaches: 2-3 different ways to phrase the request
- Edge Case Analysis: Potential issues and failure modes
- Validation Checklist: Steps to verify implementation
- Risk Assessment: "What could go wrong" analysis

---

## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Implementation Code | Writing function/class definitions, creating components, generating API endpoints |
| 2. Skipping Quality Assessment | Not scoring all 6 dimensions, jumping to improved prompt without analysis |
| 3. Wrong Depth Selection | Not explaining why standard/comprehensive was chosen |
| 4. Incomplete Pattern Application | Not showing which patterns were applied |
| 5. Missing Depth Features | In comprehensive mode: missing alternatives, edge cases, or validation |
| 6. Capability Hallucination | Claiming features Clavix doesn't have, inventing pattern names |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me return to prompt optimization."

**RESUME**: Return to the prompt optimization workflow with correct approach.

---

## Instructions

1. Take the user's prompt: `{{ARGS}}`

2. **Intent Detection** - Analyze what the user is trying to achieve:
   - **code-generation**: Writing new code or functions
   - **planning**: Designing architecture or breaking down tasks
   - **refinement**: Improving existing code or prompts
   - **debugging**: Finding and fixing issues
   - **documentation**: Creating docs or explanations
   - **prd-generation**: Creating requirements documents
   - **testing**: Writing tests, improving test coverage
   - **migration**: Version upgrades, porting code between frameworks
   - **security-review**: Security audits, vulnerability checks
   - **learning**: Conceptual understanding, tutorials, explanations
   - **summarization**: Extracting requirements from conversations

3. **Quality Assessment** - Evaluate across 6 dimensions:

   - **Clarity**: Is the objective clear and unambiguous?
   - **Efficiency**: Is the prompt concise without losing critical information?
   - **Structure**: Is information organized logically?
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary details provided?
   - **Actionability**: Can AI take immediate action on this prompt?
   - **Specificity**: How concrete and precise is the prompt? (versions, paths, identifiers)

   Score each dimension 0-100%, calculate weighted overall score.

4. **Smart Depth Selection**:

   Based on the quality assessment:

   **If Overall Quality >= 75%**:
   - Auto-select **comprehensive** depth
   - Explain: "Quality is good (XX%) - using comprehensive depth for polish"

   **If Overall Quality 60-74%**:
   - Ask user to choose:
     ```
     Quality score: XX% (borderline)

     Choose analysis depth:
     - Comprehensive: Alternative approaches, edge cases, validation checklist
     - Standard: Quick improvements and core optimization
     ```

   **If Overall Quality < 60%**:
   - Auto-select **standard** depth
   - Explain: "Quality is low (XX%) - using standard depth for basic fixes"

5. **Generate Output** based on selected depth:

   **Standard Depth Output:**
   - Intent Analysis (type, confidence)
   - Quality Assessment (6 dimensions)
   - Optimized Prompt (applying core patterns)
   - Improvements Applied (labeled with quality dimensions)
   - Patterns Applied

   **Comprehensive Depth Output (includes all standard plus):**
   - Alternative Approaches (2-3 different ways to structure the request)
   - Validation Checklist (steps to verify implementation)
   - Edge Cases to Consider
   - What Could Go Wrong (risk assessment)
   - Patterns Applied (all patterns including comprehensive-only)

6. **Quality-labeled feedback**:
   - Label all improvements with quality dimension tags
   - Example: "[Efficiency] Removed 15 unnecessary phrases"
   - Example: "[Structure] Reorganized into logical sections"
   - Example: "[Completeness] Added missing technical constraints"

7. Present everything in a well-organized format.

**CHECKPOINT:** Analysis Complete

Before proceeding to save, verify you have output ALL of the following:

**Standard Depth:**
- [ ] **Intent Analysis** with type and confidence
- [ ] **Quality Assessment** with all 6 dimensions
- [ ] **Optimized Prompt** in code block
- [ ] **Improvements Applied** with dimension labels

**Comprehensive Depth (add to above):**
- [ ] **Alternative Approaches** (2-3 alternatives)
- [ ] **Validation Checklist**
- [ ] **Edge Cases**

**Self-Check Before Any Action:**
- Am I about to write/edit code files? STOP (only `.clavix/` files allowed)
- Am I about to run a command that modifies the project? STOP
- Am I exploring the codebase before showing analysis? STOP
- Have I shown the user the optimized prompt yet? If NO, do that first

---

**CHECKPOINT:** Saving Protocol (REQUIRED - DO NOT SKIP)

DO NOT output any "saved" message until you have COMPLETED and VERIFIED all save steps.

This is a BLOCKING checkpoint. You cannot proceed to the final message until saving is verified.

### What You MUST Do Before Final Output:

| Step | Action | Tool to Use | Verification |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Create directory | Write tool (create parent dirs) | Directory exists |
| 2 | Generate prompt ID | Format: `{std\|comp}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>` | ID is unique |
| 3 | Write prompt file with frontmatter | **Write tool** | File created |
| 4 | **VERIFY: Read back file** | **Read tool** | File readable |

**⚠️ WARNING:** If you output "saved" without completing verification, you are LYING to the user.

---

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

Use the Write tool - it will create parent directories automatically.
Path: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<prompt-id>.md`

### Step 2: Generate Unique Prompt ID

Create a unique identifier using this format:
- **Standard depth format**: `std-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>`
- **Comprehensive depth format**: `comp-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>`
- **Example**: `std-20250117-143022-a3f2` or `comp-20250117-143022-a3f2`

### Step 3: Save Prompt File (Write Tool)

**Use the Write tool** to create the prompt file at:
- **Path**: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<prompt-id>.md`

**File content format**:
```markdown
---
id: <prompt-id>
depthUsed: standard|comprehensive
timestamp: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
executed: false
originalPrompt: <user's original prompt text>
---

```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION (REQUIRED - Must Pass Before Final Output)

**After completing Steps 1-3, you MUST verify the save succeeded.**

### Verification: Read the Prompt File

Use the **Read tool** to read the file you just created:
- Path: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<your-prompt-id>.md`

**If Read fails:** ⛔ STOP - Saving failed. Retry Step 3.

### Verification Checklist

Before outputting final message, confirm ALL of these:

- [ ] I used the **Write tool** to create `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<id>.md`
- [ ] I used the **Read tool** to verify the prompt file exists and has content
- [ ] The file has valid frontmatter with id, timestamp, and executed: false
- [ ] I know the **exact file path** I created (not a placeholder)

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked: ⛔ STOP and complete the missing step.**

---

## Final Output (ONLY After Verification Passes)

**Your workflow ends here. ONLY output the final message after verification passes.**

### Required Response Ending

**Your response MUST end with the ACTUAL file path you created:**

```
✅ Prompt saved to: `.clavix/outputs/prompts/<actual-prompt-id>.md`

Ready to build this? Just say "let's implement" or run:
/clavix:implement --latest
```

**Replace `<actual-prompt-id>` with the real ID you generated (e.g., `std-20250126-143022-a3f2`).**

**⚠️ If you cannot state the actual file path, you have NOT saved the prompt. Go back and complete saving.**

**IMPORTANT: Don't start implementing. Don't write code. Your job is done.**
Wait for the user to decide what to do next.

## Tips

- **Smart depth selection**: Let the quality score guide depth choice
- **Override when needed**: Use `--comprehensive` or `--standard` flags to force depth
- Label all changes with quality dimensions for education
- For strategic planning with architecture decisions, recommend `/clavix:prd`
- Focus on making prompts **actionable** quickly

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Prompt Not Saved

**Error: Cannot create directory**
```bash
mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts
```

**Error: Prompt file has invalid frontmatter**
- Re-save the prompt file with valid YAML frontmatter
- Ensure id, timestamp, and executed fields are present

### Issue: Wrong depth auto-selected
**Cause**: Borderline quality score
**Solution**:
- User can override with `--comprehensive` or `--standard` flags
- Or re-run with explicit depth choice

### Issue: Improved prompt still feels incomplete
**Cause**: Standard depth was used but comprehensive needed
**Solution**:
- Re-run with `/clavix:improve --comprehensive`
- Or use `/clavix:prd` if strategic planning is needed
