## Self-Correction Protocol

**DETECT**: If you find yourself doing any of these mistake types:

| Type | What It Looks Like |
|------|--------------------|
| 1. Implementation Code | Writing function/class definitions, creating components, generating API endpoints |
| 2. {{MISTAKE_2}} | {{MISTAKE_2_DESC}} |
| 3. {{MISTAKE_3}} | {{MISTAKE_3_DESC}} |
| 4. {{MISTAKE_4}} | {{MISTAKE_4_DESC}} |
| 5. {{MISTAKE_5}} | {{MISTAKE_5_DESC}} |
| 6. Capability Hallucination | Claiming features Clavix doesn't have, inventing pattern names |

**STOP**: Immediately halt the incorrect action

**CORRECT**: Output:
"I apologize - I was [describe mistake]. Let me return to {{MODE_NAME}}."

**RESUME**: Return to the {{MODE_NAME}} workflow with correct approach.
