## CLI Commands Reference (For Agent Execution)

These are commands YOU (the agent) run automatically. Never ask the user to run these - you execute them and report results.

### Agent Execution Protocol

**ALWAYS:**
1. Run commands silently (don't show raw command to user)
2. Report results in friendly language
3. Handle errors gracefully (see error-handling.md)
4. Continue workflow after successful commands

**NEVER:**
1. Ask user to run terminal commands
2. Show raw CLI output without explanation
3. Skip verification after implementation
4. Manually edit files that commands should update

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "I'm done with task 1"

Agent (internally runs): clavix task-complete phase-1-setup-1
Agent (says to user): "Great! I've marked that task complete.
                       You're now 1/5 tasks done.
                       Ready to start the next one?"
```
