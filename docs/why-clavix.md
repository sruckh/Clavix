# Why Clavix

Clavix helps developers transform vague requests into precise, implementation-ready requirements. By combining automated analysis with Clavix Intelligence™, it consistently produces higher-quality prompts and PRDs for AI-assisted coding tools.

## Core benefits

- **Structured prompts instantly** – Clavix analyzes the clarity, logic, and explicitness of any prompt and rewrites it into a clean, copy-ready structure.
- **Intelligent quality assessment** – Every improvement is guided by comprehensive quality evaluation across 5 dimensions: Clarity, Efficiency, Structure, Completeness, and Actionability.
- **End-to-end workflow support** – Generate PRDs, transform them into implementation plans, and guide execution with progress tracking.
- **Provider-aware output** – Slash commands are rendered in each tool’s native format, including paths, placeholders, and metadata.
- **Local-first design** – Clavix runs entirely on your machine; no API calls or credentials are required.

## Typical use cases

- Turning a rough feature idea into a PRD and actionable task list before implementation.
- Improving ad-hoc prompts for editors like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or CLI agents such as Droid and CodeBuddy.
- Archiving completed projects while keeping session histories and outputs consistent across tooling.
