## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-14

### 🎉 Major Features

#### Multi-Provider Support
- **Breaking Change**: Config now uses `providers: string[]` instead of `agent: string`
- Interactive multi-select checkbox UI during `clavix init`
- Select multiple AI development tools simultaneously
- Automatic config migration from v1.3.0 → v1.4.0

#### New Provider Support
- ✨ **Cursor** - `.cursor/commands/` (flat structure, no frontmatter)
- ✨ **Droid CLI** - `.factory/commands/` (YAML frontmatter, `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder)
- ✨ **OpenCode** - `.opencode/command/` (frontmatter with description, `$ARGUMENTS`)
- ✨ **Amp** - `.agents/commands/` (simple markdown, experimental executable support)
- ✨ **Universal agents.md** - Workflow instructions for tools without slash command support

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- Introduced `BaseAdapter` abstract class for shared adapter logic
- Plugin-based provider system ensures backward compatibility
- Per-provider validation before command generation
- Template system with `{{ARGS}}` placeholder replaced by adapter-specific formats
- Isolated provider modules - adding new providers doesn't affect existing ones

### 🔧 Enhancements
- Enhanced `AgentAdapter` interface with `directory`, `fileExtension`, `features` properties
- Added `ProviderFeatures` interface for provider-specific capabilities
- Added `ValidationResult` interface for adapter validation
- Config migration utilities: `migrateConfig()`, `isLegacyConfig()`
- `AgentManager` now registers all 5 provider adapters
- Per-provider validation with error/warning reporting
- Improved init command UX with provider descriptions and checkbox validation

### 📝 Templates
- Created provider-specific template directories for all 5 providers
- Universal `agents.md` template with workflow detection and CLEAR framework integration
- Standardized `{{ARGS}}` placeholder across all base templates
- Provider adapters transform placeholders to tool-specific formats

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- TypeScript compilation successful across all new code
- Backward compatibility maintained for v1.3.0 configurations
- BaseAdapter inheritance tested across all provider adapters

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README with supported tools table
- Multi-provider selection example in Quick Start
- Updated "AI Agent Integration" section
- Comprehensive PRD and implementation plan in `.clavix/outputs/`
- Migration guide for v1.3.0 users

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Config field `agent: string` replaced with `providers: string[]`
- Old configs automatically migrated on next `clavix init`
- No manual migration required - fully automated

### 📦 Migration Guide
If upgrading from v1.3.0:
1. Run `clavix init` in your project
2. Select desired providers (old provider pre-selected)
3. Config automatically migrated to v1.4.0 format
4. Slash commands regenerated for all selected providers
