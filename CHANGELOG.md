## [1.5.1] - 2025-11-14

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Archive Detection Improvements
- **Enhanced PRD File Detection**: Extended support for multiple naming conventions in archive detection
  - Now recognizes: `FULL_PRD.md`, `QUICK_PRD.md`, `FULL-PRD.md` (uppercase and hyphenated variants)
  - Previously only detected: `PRD.md`, `full-prd.md`, `prd.md`, `Full-PRD.md`
- **Resolved Issue**: Manually archived projects with non-standard PRD filenames now appear in `clavix archive --list`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Updated `possibleFiles` array in `src/core/archive-manager.ts:328`
  - Updated `possibleFiles` array in `src/core/task-manager.ts:611`
  - Both detection methods now consistently support all naming variants

**Impact**: Projects archived manually (e.g., via `clavix archive project-name`) that use uppercase or alternative naming conventions are now properly detected and listed.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-14

### 🚀 Major Features

#### Vibecoding-Optimized PRD Generation
- **Streamlined Questions**: Reduced from 8 questions to 5 focused questions for faster workflow
- **Smart Tech Detection**: Auto-detects tech stack from project files (package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, Cargo.toml, composer.json)
- **CLEAR Framework Integration**: Questions designed with CLEAR principles (Concise, Logical, Explicit)
- **Maintained Quality**: All essential information captured without ceremony

### 🎯 New PRD Question Structure

**5 Focused Questions:**
1. 🎯 **Problem & Goal** (Required) - What are we building and why?
2. ⚡ **Core Features** (Required) - Must-have functionality (3-5 features)
3. 🔧 **Tech Stack** (Smart/Optional) - Auto-detected or manual input
4. 🚫 **Out of Scope** (Required) - Explicit boundaries
5. 💡 **Additional Context** (Optional) - Bonus information

**Removed Questions:**
- ❌ Target users - Unnecessary for personal projects and vibecoding
- ❌ Success metrics - Too "corporate" for fast iteration
- ❌ Deadlines/milestones - Not applicable for AI-driven development

### ✨ Smart Tech Stack Detection

**Automatic Detection:**
- Scans common config files in project root
- Detects frameworks from package.json dependencies (React, Vue, Next.js, Astro, etc.)
- Supports Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI), Ruby (Rails), Go, Rust, PHP (Laravel, Symfony)
- Shows detected stack with option to press Enter to accept or type to override
- Gracefully skips if extending existing project

**User Experience:**
```
🔧 Tech stack and requirements?
  Detected: TypeScript, Astro, Tailwind CSS (press Enter to use, or type to override)
```

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

**PRD Generator:**
- Added `detectProjectTechStack()` method in `prd.ts` for intelligent stack detection
- Updated question mapping: q1 → problem, q2 → features, q3 → technical, q4 → outOfScope, q5 → additional
- Enhanced question flow with conditional smart detection for Q3
- Auto-populates Q3 with detected stack if user presses Enter

**Templates:**
- Updated `prd-questions.md` with 5 streamlined questions and emoji indicators
- Simplified `full-prd-template.hbs` - removed users, success, timeline sections
- Optimized `quick-prd-template.hbs` for vibecoding workflow
- Updated acceptance criteria to reflect new structure

**Documentation:**
- Updated `.claude/commands/clavix/prd.md` slash command description
- Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` with vibecoding-optimized workflow details
- Updated `README.md` features and command descriptions

### 📊 Impact

**Time Savings:**
- ~40% reduction in question count (8 → 5 questions)
- Smart defaults for tech stack reduce manual input
- Optional questions can be skipped entirely

**Quality Maintained:**
- CLEAR validation still applies (C, L, E components)
- All essential project context captured
- Out-of-scope boundaries remain required for clarity

### 🎨 UX Enhancements

- Emoji indicators for each question type
- Clear "(Required)" vs "(Optional)" labels
- Helpful inline hints (e.g., "press Enter to skip if extending existing project")
- Color-coded detected tech stack display

### 📝 Migration Notes

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing PRD templates continue to work
- Custom templates in `.clavix/templates/` still supported
- CLEAR validation unchanged (C, L, E only for PRDs)

**New Behavior:**
- Q3 (tech stack) now auto-detects from project files
- Users can press Enter to skip optional questions
- Generated PRDs have simpler section structure

## [1.4.1] - 2025-11-14

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Missing Commands in New Providers
- **Fixed**: Added missing `plan.md` and `implement.md` commands to all providers
- **Affected**: Cursor, Droid CLI, OpenCode, Amp providers
- **Root cause**: Commands were added to deployed location instead of source templates in v1.3.0
- **Impact**: Users selecting new providers (cursor, droid, opencode, amp) now receive complete command set including `/clavix:plan` and `/clavix:implement`

### 📝 What Was Fixed
- Added `plan.md` to all 5 provider template directories
- Added `implement.md` to all 5 provider template directories
- Verified frontmatter compatibility with Droid and OpenCode YAML requirements
- All providers now have feature parity with Claude Code

### ✅ Complete Command List (All Providers)
- `/clavix:fast` - Quick prompt improvements
- `/clavix:deep` - Comprehensive analysis
- `/clavix:prd` - PRD generation
- `/clavix:plan` - Task breakdown ✨ NEW for cursor/droid/opencode/amp
- `/clavix:implement` - Task execution ✨ NEW for cursor/droid/opencode/amp
- `/clavix:start` - Conversational mode
- `/clavix:summarize` - Extract requirements
