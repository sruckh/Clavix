## [3.5.0] - 2025-01-24

### 🔄 Breaking Changes (With Automatic Migration)

#### Terminology Update: "Providers" → "Integrations"
Renamed core terminology from "providers" to "integrations" throughout Clavix for improved semantic clarity and industry alignment.

**What Changed**:
- **Configuration**: `config.integrations` replaces `config.providers` in `.clavix/config.json`
- **TypeScript Types**:
  - `ClavixConfig.integrations` replaces `ClavixConfig.providers`
  - `IntegrationFeatures` replaces `ProviderFeatures` (deprecated type alias maintained for backward compatibility)
- **CLI Commands**:
  - `clavix config` menu now shows "Manage integrations (add/remove)"
  - `clavix init` displays "integration" terminology throughout
  - `clavix update` uses "integrations" in all output messages
- **Documentation**:
  - Renamed `docs/providers.md` → `docs/integrations.md`
  - Updated all references across README, guides, and templates
- **Utilities**: Renamed `provider-selector.ts` → `integration-selector.ts`

**Why**: The term "provider" implied Clavix receives a service FROM these tools, when actually Clavix integrates WITH them. "Integration" more accurately describes the relationship (Clavix ↔ AI Tools) and aligns with industry standards (VS Code integrations, Zapier integrations, etc.).

**Backward Compatibility**:
- ✅ **Automatic Migration**: Old configs with `"providers": []` are automatically migrated to `"integrations": []`
- ✅ **Zero User Action Required**: Migration happens transparently on first config load
- ✅ **Type Alias**: `ProviderFeatures` maintained as deprecated alias (removed in v4.0.0)
- ✅ **Config Fallback**: `config.providers` reads work during transition period

**Impact**:
- **For End Users**: Seamless upgrade with automatic migration - no manual changes needed
- **For TypeScript Users**: If importing `ProviderFeatures` type, update to `IntegrationFeatures` (deprecation warning added)

This follows the same proven migration pattern used in v1.4.0 (`agent` → `providers`).

## [3.4.0] - 2025-11-23

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Provider Categorization in `clavix init`
Fixed multiple provider categorization issues in the interactive provider selection menu.

**What Changed**:
- **CLI Tools** - Properly categorized:
  - Moved Claude Code from IDE to CLI section
  - Moved CodeBuddy from IDE to CLI section
  - Moved Crush from IDE to CLI section
- **IDE Tools** - Properly categorized:
  - Moved Kilocode from CLI to IDE section
  - Moved Roocode from CLI to IDE section
- **Universal Adapters**:
  - Added missing WARP.md option (implementation existed but was not in selector)
  - Removed non-functional "Custom" option (had no adapter implementation)
- **Display Names**:
  - Cleaned up Qwen display name (removed Chinese symbols "通义灵码")
  - Improved clarity of Universal Adapter names

**Why**: The v3.3.0 refactor that extracted providers into a shared utility (`provider-selector.ts`) introduced categorization errors. This release corrects all misclassifications and ensures the provider list matches the actual tool types.

**Impact**: Users will now see providers correctly organized by type (CLI Tools, IDE & IDE Extensions, Universal Adapters) when running `clavix init` or `clavix config`.

This is a **minor version bump** due to the addition of WARP.md as a new selectable option.

## [3.2.1] - 2025-11-23

### 🐛 Bug Fix

#### LLXPRT Provider Categorization
Fixed incorrect categorization of LLXPRT provider in `clavix init` command.

**What Changed**:
- Moved LLXPRT from "IDE & IDE Extensions" section to "CLI Tools" section
- LLXPRT now appears alphabetically between Gemini CLI and OpenCode
- Documentation in `docs/integrations.md` was already correct (no changes needed)

**Why**: LLXPRT is a CLI tool, not an IDE extension. This fix ensures proper categorization in the interactive provider selection menu.

This is a **patch release** with no breaking changes or functional impact.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ New Provider Support

#### LLXPRT Integration
Added support for **LLXPRT** - a new AI coding CLI tool with TOML-based custom commands.

**Features**:
- TOML format with `prompt = """..."""` wrapper
- Namespace support: commands accessible as `/clavix:fast`, `/clavix:deep`, etc.
- Commands generated in `.llxprt/commands/clavix/` directory
- Argument placeholder: `{{args}}`
- Subdirectory support enabled

**What Changed**:
- New `LlxprtAdapter` class following established Clavix patterns
- Added to provider selection in `clavix init` command
- Full test coverage with 6 new tests
- Documentation updated in `docs/integrations.md`

**Total Providers**: Now supports **16 built-in adapters** + 4 universal adapters (20 total integrations)

This is a **non-breaking minor version** - existing configurations remain unchanged.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-11-23

### ✨ Branding Evolution - Clavix Intelligence™

**Major Update**: Rebranded from "Universal Intelligence" and "Adaptive Prompt Intelligence™" to **"Clavix Intelligence™"** across all user-facing content. This establishes Clavix as a distinctive branded methodology rather than generic terminology.

#### What Changed
- **Marketing & Documentation**: All references to "Universal Intelligence" and "Adaptive Prompt Intelligence™" now use "Clavix Intelligence™"
- **Brand Identity**: Establishes Clavix as a recognizable methodology and strengthens brand presence
- **Documentation**: Renamed `docs/prompt-intelligence.md` → `docs/clavix-intelligence.md`

## [2.9.0] - 2025-11-18

### Changed

#### ESLint 9+ Migration with Flat Config

**Major Upgrade**: Migrated from ESLint 8 (legacy eslintrc) to ESLint 9 with modern flat config format.

**Dependencies Updated**:
- `eslint`: ^8.57.0 → ^9.17.0
- Added `@eslint/js@^9.17.0` (required for flat config presets)
- Added `typescript-eslint@^8.46.4` (unified TypeScript-ESLint package)
- Kept `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^8.46.4` and `@typescript-eslint/parser@^8.46.4` (already ESLint 9 compatible)

**Configuration Changes**:
- Migrated from `.eslintrc.json` to `eslint.config.js` (flat config format)
- Implemented TypeScript's `projectService` for better performance (faster than legacy `project` option)
- Uses new `tseslint.config()` wrapper for type-safe configuration
- Configured separate rules for `src/` files with type-aware linting
- Excluded test files from linting (matching tsconfig.json exclusions)
- Updated npm scripts: removed `--ext .ts` flags (now defined in config)

**Preserved Custom Rules**:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`: warn
- `@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types`: off
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`: error with `argsIgnorePattern: '^_'` and `caughtErrors: 'all'`
- `no-console`: off

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Better performance with `projectService` configuration
- ✅ Modern ESLint 9 recommended ruleset with new safety checks
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable flat config format
- ✅ Future-proof for upcoming ESLint and TypeScript-ESLint features
- ✅ All 1,592 tests pass
- ✅ No breaking changes to source code
- ✅ CI/CD compatible (no workflow changes needed)

**Migration Details**:
- Deleted legacy `.eslintrc.json`
- Created new `eslint.config.js` with ESLint 9 flat config
- Test files excluded from linting (already excluded from tsconfig.json)
- Proper Node.js globals configuration
- Ignores: `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `coverage/`, `bin/`, `tests/`

## [2.8.3] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

#### Task ID Persistence in tasks.md

**Problem**: Task IDs were never written to `tasks.md`, only regenerated from phase names on read. This caused mismatches between config expectations and actual task IDs, breaking `clavix task-complete`.

**Symptom**:
```bash
# tasks.md showed (user added manually):
Task ID: phase-1-setup-1

# CLI expected (regenerated from "Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration"):
Task ID: phase-1-project-setup-configur-1  # Truncated at 30 chars

# Result:
✗ Task ID "phase-1-setup-1" not found
```

**Root Cause**:
- `writeTasksFile()` never wrote Task ID lines to tasks.md
- `parseTasksFile()` regenerated IDs from phase names instead of reading from file
- `sanitizeId()` truncated phase names to 30 chars ("configuration" → "configur")
- Manual Task IDs added by users/agents were ignored

**Fix**:
1. **Write Task IDs**: `writeTasksFile()` now writes `  Task ID: {id}` after each task
2. **Read Task IDs**: `parseTasksFile()` reads IDs from file with fallback to regeneration
3. **Backward Compatible**: Old tasks.md files without IDs still work (IDs regenerated on read)
4. **Manual Edits Respected**: Task IDs from file take priority over regeneration

**Impact**:
- ✅ `clavix task-complete phase-1-setup-1` works with readable IDs
- ✅ Task IDs persist across write-read cycles
- ✅ No more truncated/obfuscated IDs
- ✅ Existing projects continue working (backward compatible)

**Test Coverage**:
- Write Task IDs to tasks.md
- Read Task IDs from tasks.md
- Preserve IDs through write-read cycle
- Fallback to regeneration for old format
- Use file IDs over regenerated IDs
- Mark task complete with readable ID

**Example tasks.md Format**:
```markdown
## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] Initialize React project (ref: Technical Requirements)
  Task ID: phase-1-setup-1
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS (ref: Technical Requirements)
  Task ID: phase-1-setup-2
```

- Fix ESLint unused variables warnings in task-manager.ts

## [2.8.2] - 2025-11-17

### Added

#### Complete Documentation Coverage for v2.7-v2.8 Features

**Background**: Comprehensive documentation audit revealed critical gaps where recent features (v2.7.0 prompt lifecycle, v2.8.0 task generation, v2.8.1 task-complete) lacked user-facing documentation despite having excellent agent template coverage.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

#### Prompt Saving in Agent Execution Context

**Problem**: Templates for `/clavix:fast` and `/clavix:deep` slash commands did not instruct AI agents to save prompts when executed directly. Only the CLI commands (`clavix fast` / `clavix deep`) automatically saved prompts, breaking the prompt lifecycle workflow for agent-driven workflows.

**Root Cause**: Templates violated the AI-Agent-First Design Philosophy by assuming automatic saving without providing explicit agent instructions, creating a gap between CLI behavior and slash command behavior.

**Solution**: Implemented Dual Mode (Hybrid) approach with explicit saving instructions:

**Template Updates:**

1. **Canonical Templates** (`fast.md`, `deep.md`):
   - Added comprehensive "Saving the Prompt (REQUIRED)" section with conditional logic
   - **Step 1**: Directory creation (`mkdir -p .clavix/outputs/prompts/{fast|deep}`)
   - **Step 2**: Prompt ID generation (`{fast|deep}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<random>`)
   - **Step 3**: File creation with frontmatter (Write tool instructions)
   - **Step 4**: Index update (`.index.json` management)
   - **Step 5**: Verification confirmation
   - Added troubleshooting section for saving errors

2. **Provider Templates** (agents.md, octo.md, warp.md, copilot-instructions.md):
   - Updated command reference tables to clarify: "CLI auto-saves; slash commands require manual saving per template instructions"
   - Updated workflow documentation to reflect dual saving modes

**File Format Specification:**
```markdown
---
id: <prompt-id>
source: {fast|deep}
timestamp: <ISO-8601>
executed: false
originalPrompt: <original text>
---

# Improved Prompt
<CLEAR-optimized content>

## CLEAR Scores
- C, L, E (fast) or C, L, E, A, R (deep)

## Original Prompt
<original text>
```

**Testing:**
- Added comprehensive template coverage tests (v2.8.1) validating:
  - Presence of saving instructions in canonical templates
  - Step-by-step format verification
  - File format specification completeness
  - Troubleshooting section coverage
  - Provider template clarification language

**Files Modified:**
- `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/fast.md` - Added 100+ lines of saving instructions
- `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/deep.md` - Added 100+ lines of saving instructions (with A/R components)
- `src/templates/agents/agents.md` - Updated command table descriptions
- `src/templates/agents/octo.md` - Updated CLI reference
- `src/templates/agents/warp.md` - Updated common commands list
- `src/templates/agents/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated prompt improvement and lifecycle workflow sections
- `tests/integration/template-coverage.test.ts` - Added 10 new test cases

**Impact:**
- ✅ Prompts now save consistently in both CLI and agent execution contexts
- ✅ Agents receive explicit, actionable instructions (not passive documentation)
- ✅ Prompt lifecycle workflow (optimize → review → execute → cleanup) now works end-to-end
- ✅ Compliance with AI-Agent-First Design Philosophy and Template Quality Checklist

**Example Agent Workflow:**
```bash

## [2.8.0] - 2025-11-17

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES - ESM Migration

**Node.js 16+ Required**: Clavix is now a pure ESM package using TypeScript NodeNext module system.

#### Why This Migration?

**Future-Proofing & Modern Standards:**
- ESM is the JavaScript standard (CommonJS is legacy)
- Required for modern dependencies (chalk v5+, ora v8+, inquirer v10+)
- Better tree-shaking and bundle optimization
- Native TypeScript support with proper module resolution

**Immediate Benefits:**
- ✅ Unlocked chalk v5.4.1 (from v4.1.2) - Better color support and performance
- ✅ Modern dependency ecosystem access
- ✅ Faster startup times with native ES modules
- ✅ Improved type safety with NodeNext resolution

#### Migration Requirements

**For End Users:**
```bash
# Minimum Node.js version
node --version  # Must be v16.0.0 or higher

# Upgrade Clavix
npm install -g clavix@2.8.0

# No code changes needed - CLI usage unchanged
clavix init
clavix prd
clavix plan
```

**For Developers/Contributors:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build (now uses ES2020 modules)
npm run build

# Run tests (with ESM experimental flag)
npm test  # Uses --experimental-vm-modules for Jest
```

#### What Changed Internally

**Package Configuration (`package.json`):**
- Added `"type": "module"` for pure ESM
- Updated exports to ESM syntax
- All dependencies now use ESM-compatible versions
- Chalk upgraded: v4.1.2 → v5.4.1

**TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`):**
- `module`: `"CommonJS"` → `"ES2020"`
- `moduleResolution`: `"node"` → `"NodeNext"`
- `target`: `"ES2020"` → `"ES2021"`
- Added `"lib": ["ES2021"]` for modern JS features

**Source Code (139 files modified):**
- Import syntax: `require()` → `import` statements
- Export syntax: `module.exports` → `export` declarations
- File extensions: Added `.js` to all relative imports
- `__dirname` replacement: Custom utility for ESM compatibility
- Dynamic imports: `await import()` for runtime loading

**Build & Testing:**
- Jest configuration: Added `--experimental-vm-modules` flag
- Jest config: Converted `jest.config.js` → `jest.config.mjs`
- All test imports: Updated to use `import` from `@jest/globals`
- Template loading: Updated for ESM module resolution
- Binary shebang: Maintained `#!/usr/bin/env node` compatibility

#### Files Modified Summary

**Core Infrastructure (10 files):**
- `package.json` - ESM type, exports, dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - NodeNext module system
- `jest.config.mjs` - ESM-compatible Jest config
- `bin/clavix.js` - ESM entry point
- `src/index.ts` - ESM exports
- Build scripts and utilities

**Source Code (129 files):**
- All CLI commands (15 files in `src/cli/commands/`)
- All core modules (15 files in `src/core/`)
- All adapters (16 files in `src/core/adapters/`)
- All utilities (5 files in `src/utils/`)
- All tests (78 files in `tests/`)

#### Validation & Testing

✅ **All 1581 tests passing** with ESM configuration
✅ **Zero regressions** - All functionality preserved
✅ **Build succeeds** - TypeScript compilation error-free
✅ **Runtime verified** - All CLI commands working
✅ **Coverage maintained** - 90%+ test coverage preserved

#### Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you encounter issues with v2.8.0:

```bash
# Downgrade to v2.8.1 (pre-ESM)
npm install -g clavix@2.8.1

# Or use npx for isolated execution
npx clavix@2.8.1 init
```

**Known compatibility:**
- Works on: Node.js 16.x, 18.x, 20.x, 21.x, 22.x
- Does NOT work on: Node.js 14.x or earlier (ESM support incomplete)

---

### 🎉 NEW FEATURE - Intelligent Task Generator

#### Problem Solved

**Before v2.8.0:** The `clavix plan` command generated excessive, unusable task breakdowns:
- 401 tasks in 80 phases for ESM migration PRD (should be ~30 tasks)
- Every nested bullet treated as separate feature
- Fixed 5-task boilerplate for all features (implement, test, integrate, document, validate)
- No hierarchical understanding of PRD structure

**After v2.8.0:** Smart, context-aware task generation:
- 15-30 tasks in 5-8 logical phases for same PRD
- Only top-level features extracted (nested bullets = implementation details)
- Context-aware templates (1-2 tasks per feature, not fixed 5)
- Intelligent phase grouping by category

#### What Changed

**1. Hierarchical PRD Parsing** (`src/core/task-manager.ts:extractListItems()`)
- Line-by-line parsing instead of flat regex matching
- Only extracts bullets with ZERO indentation (top-level features)
- Skips nested bullets (constraints, requirements, sub-details)
- Filters out code examples and file paths
- Detects implementation details ("must", "should", "required")

**Example:**
```markdown
Before: Treated as 3 separate tasks ❌
- User authentication
  - Password must be 8+ characters
  - Email validation required

After: 1 feature with 2 implementation details ✅
- User authentication (→ 2 tasks: implement + test)
```

**2. Context-Aware Task Templates** (`src/core/task-manager.ts:buildFeatureTaskDescriptions()`)

| Feature Type | Old | New | Example |
|--------------|-----|-----|---------|
| Configuration | 5 tasks | **1 task** | "Update tsconfig.json for ESM" |
| Documentation | 5 tasks | **1 task** | "Update CHANGELOG.md" |
| Testing | 5 tasks | **2 tasks** | Implement + Verify passes |
| Conversion | 5 tasks | **2 tasks** | Convert + Test works |
| Default | 5 tasks | **2 tasks** | Implement + Add tests |

**Result:** ~50% reduction in task count for same features

**3. Task Grouping by Category** (`src/core/task-manager.ts:groupFeaturesByCategory()`)

Instead of "1 bullet = 1 phase", features are intelligently grouped:
- **Configuration & Setup** - Config files, dependencies, environment
- **Core Implementation** - Main features and functionality
- **Testing & Validation** - Test suites, QA, verification
- **Documentation** - README, CHANGELOG, guides
- **Integration & Release** - Build, deploy, publish

**Result:** 5 logical phases instead of 80 arbitrary phases

**4. Granularity Controls** (`src/core/task-manager.ts:generatePhasesFromCoreFeatures()`)
- Warning if >50 top-level features detected in PRD
- Warning if >50 total tasks generated
- Automatic skipping of empty phases
- Suggestion to simplify over-detailed PRDs

#### Real-World Impact

**Test Case: Authentication Feature PRD**
- **Before:** 31 tasks in 3 phases (every constraint = separate task)
- **After:** 15 tasks in 2 phases (52% reduction)
- **Quality:** All essential work captured, no boilerplate bloat

**ESM Migration PRD (This Release):**
- **Old generator:** 401 tasks in 80 phases (unusable)
- **Manual planning:** 34 tasks in 8 phases (optimal)
- **New generator:** Expected 20-30 tasks in 5-8 phases (usable)

#### Code Changes

**Modified Files (1):**
- `src/core/task-manager.ts` - 260+ lines changed
  - Lines 263-413: Hierarchical parsing logic
  - Lines 220-323: Category grouping logic
  - Lines 415-461: Context-aware templates
  - New methods: `looksLikeCodeOrPath()`, `looksLikeImplementationDetail()`, `groupFeaturesByCategory()`

**Documentation:**
- `ESM_MIGRATION_NOTES.md` - Complete analysis and algorithm documentation

**Testing:**
- ✅ All 1581 tests passing
- ✅ New validation test with authentication PRD
- ✅ Zero regressions in existing workflows

#### User Experience

**Before v2.8.0:**
```bash
clavix plan
# Generated tasks.md with 401 tasks
# 80 phases to manage
# Unusable for actual implementation
```

**After v2.8.0:**
```bash
clavix plan
# Generated tasks.md with 25 tasks
# 5 logical phases
# Actually implementable workflow

# Smart warnings when PRD is too detailed:
⚠️  Warning: PRD contains 72 top-level features. Consider grouping related items.
⚠️  Warning: Generated 58 tasks. Consider merging related tasks or simplifying PRD.
```

#### Future Enhancements (Not in 2.8.0)

Potential improvements for future versions:
- `--granularity` CLI flag to control task detail level
- PRD linting to warn about over-detailed specifications
- Custom category definitions via `.clavixrc`

## [2.8.1] - 2025-11-17

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **`clavix implement`**: Now defaults to `--commit-strategy=none` (manual git workflow) instead of showing interactive prompt
  - **Migration**: To enable auto-commits, explicitly specify: `clavix implement --commit-strategy=<type>`
  - **Options**: `per-task`, `per-5-tasks`, `per-phase`, `none`
  - **Rationale**: Enables AI agents to execute implementation workflows without blocking on interactive prompts

### ✨ New Features - Agent-Friendly Execution

Transform Clavix into a fully non-blocking tool for AI agent automation.

**Agent-First Commands:**
- **`clavix implement --commit-strategy=<type>`**: Explicit git strategy selection (no interactive prompt)
  - Defaults to `'none'` (manual git workflow) if flag not provided
  - Agents can optionally ask users for git preference when tasks.md has >3 phases
  - Maintains all existing git automation capabilities

- **`clavix archive --yes` / `-y`**: Skip all confirmation prompts
  - Archive projects without user interaction: `clavix archive my-project --yes`
  - Restore projects without confirmation: `clavix archive --restore project-1 --yes`

- **`clavix update --force`**: Skip legacy cleanup confirmation (fixed)
  - Previously `--force` didn't skip all prompts
  - Now fully non-interactive: `clavix update --force`

### 🤖 Agent Template Updates

Updated all agent integration templates with git strategy workflow guidance:
- `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/implement.md` - Added git strategy selection workflow
- `src/templates/agents/agents.md` - Added "Implementation with Git Strategy" section
- `src/templates/agents/octo.md` - Added git auto-commit strategy guidance
- `src/templates/agents/warp.md` - Updated command list with flags
- `src/templates/agents/copilot-instructions.md` - Updated strategic planning section

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Improvements

- **`task-complete.ts`**: Fixed stale in-memory bug preventing task advancement
  - Root cause: `phases` object not refreshed after marking task complete in file
  - Fix: Re-read tasks.md after successful completion to sync in-memory state
  - Impact: `clavix task-complete` now correctly shows NEXT task instead of same task

- **`prompts/clear.ts`**: `--force` flag already correctly skips all prompts ✅
- **`archive.ts`**: Added comprehensive `--yes` flag support across all confirmation prompts

### 📚 Modified Files (12 total)

**CLI Commands (6)**:
- `src/cli/commands/implement.ts` - Removed git prompt, default to 'none'
- `src/cli/commands/task-complete.ts` - Fixed stale phases bug
- `src/cli/commands/archive.ts` - Added --yes flag
- `src/cli/commands/update.ts` - Fixed --force to skip legacy cleanup
- `src/cli/commands/prompts/clear.ts` - Verified --force works correctly

**Templates (5)**:
- `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/implement.md`
- `src/templates/agents/agents.md`
- `src/templates/agents/octo.md`
- `src/templates/agents/warp.md`
- `src/templates/agents/copilot-instructions.md`

### 🎯 Why This Matters

**Before v2.8.1:**
```bash
# Agent executes /clavix:implement
clavix implement
# ❌ BLOCKS on interactive git strategy prompt
# Agent workflow cannot continue
```

**After v2.8.1:**
```bash
# Agent executes with default
clavix implement
# ✅ Proceeds immediately (default: manual git)

# Or agent asks user, then specifies:
clavix implement --commit-strategy=per-phase
# ✅ No prompts, full automation
```

**Example Agent Workflow (Now Possible):**
```bash
# Full automation without blocking
clavix prd                                  # Human-guided PRD
clavix plan                                 # Generate tasks
clavix implement --commit-strategy=none     # Agent implements (no prompts)
clavix task-complete phase-1-setup-1        # Mark complete
clavix archive my-project --yes             # Archive (no confirmation)
```

### 📖 Documentation

Agent integration patterns documented in all provider templates. After running `clavix init`, see:
- `.claude/commands/clavix/implement.md` - Implementation workflow with git strategy
- `docs/agents.md` - Universal agent instructions
- Provider-specific templates (Octofriend, Warp, Copilot)

  ```
  - Status indicators: ✓ EXECUTED, ○ NEW
  - Age warnings: >7 days = OLD (yellow), >30 days = STALE (red)
  - Grouped by source (fast/deep)
  - Storage statistics dashboard:
    - Total prompts count
    - Fast vs deep breakdown
    - Executed vs pending counts
    - Oldest prompt age
  - Hygiene recommendations (stale prompts, executed cleanup, storage limits)

- **`clavix prompts clear` - Storage Hygiene Management**
  ```bash
  clavix prompts clear                 # Interactive cleanup
  clavix prompts clear --executed      # Clear executed prompts (safe)
  clavix prompts clear --stale         # Clear prompts >30 days old
  clavix prompts clear --fast          # Clear fast mode prompts
  clavix prompts clear --deep          # Clear deep mode prompts
  clavix prompts clear --all           # Clear all (with confirmation)
  clavix prompts clear --all --force   # Skip confirmations
  ```
  - Safety confirmations before deletion
  - Preview before cleanup
  - Unexecuted prompt warnings
  - Filter composition (combine flags)

---

## [2.3.1] - 2025-11-16

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Consistent Provider Naming**: Updated AGENTS.md provider display name in `clavix init` to follow the same pattern as other universal adapters
  - Changed from: `'agents.md (Universal - for tools without slash commands)'`
  - Changed to: `'Agents (AGENTS.md - Universal - for tools without slash commands)'`
  - Now consistent with GitHub Copilot, Warp, and Octofriend naming patterns

---

## [2.3.0] - 2025-11-16

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **GitHub Copilot Integration Migration**: Moved from non-working slash commands (`.github/agents/`) to official repository instructions (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
  - Old `.github/agents/clavix-*.agent.md` files no longer generated
  - Copilot now uses natural language instructions per [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)
  - Copilot moved from "CLI Tools" to "Universal Adapters" section in `clavix init`

### ✨ Features
- **GitHub Copilot Instructions Generator**: New adapter for `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - Generates natural language Clavix workflow instructions for GitHub Copilot
  - Uses managed blocks (`<!-- CLAVIX:START -->` / `<!-- CLAVIX:END -->`) for easy updates via `clavix update`
  - Includes command reference, CLEAR Framework principles, and workflow patterns
  - Automatically creates `.github/` directory if needed

### 🗑️ Removed
- `CopilotAdapter` class (replaced with `CopilotInstructionsGenerator`)
- Copilot slash command templates (8 files: `archive.agent.md`, `deep.agent.md`, `fast.agent.md`, etc.)
- Agent type `'copilot'` (replaced with `'copilot-instructions'`)

### 🔧 Technical Changes
- **New Files**:
  - `src/templates/agents/copilot-instructions.md` - Copilot workflow instructions template
  - `src/core/adapters/copilot-instructions-generator.ts` - Generator class for `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Modified Files**:
  - `src/cli/commands/init.ts` - Updated provider selection UI
  - `src/core/agent-manager.ts` - Removed CopilotAdapter registration
  - `src/types/agent.ts` - Updated AgentType union
- **Deleted Files**:

  - `src/templates/slash-commands/copilot/*.agent.md` (8 files)

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated README.md: Copilot now listed under "Universal adapters"
- Updated docs/integrations.md: Changed Copilot entry to GitHub Copilot with `.github/copilot-instructions.md` path
- CHANGELOG.md: This entry

### 🎯 Migration Guide
**For existing Copilot users:**
1. Run `clavix init` and select "GitHub Copilot (.github/copilot-instructions.md)"
2. Old `.github/agents/clavix-*.agent.md` files can be safely deleted
3. GitHub Copilot will now read instructions from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. Use `clavix update` to refresh instructions in future versions

**Why this change?**
- GitHub Copilot doesn't support custom slash commands via `.github/agents/`
- Official documentation specifies `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repository-wide instructions
- Natural language instructions provide better integration with Copilot's AI

## [1.9.0] - 2025-11-15

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes / Migrations
- Standardized flat-provider command filenames to `clavix-<command>` and relocated Cline workflows to `.clinerules/workflows/`; legacy filenames are auto-detected with an opt-out cleanup prompt during `clavix init` and `clavix update`.

### ✨ Enhancements
- Added adapter filename overrides and shared template loader so all providers respect the new naming scheme while keeping namespaced folders (e.g., `.claude/commands/clavix/`).
- Implemented legacy command cleanup utilities reused by init/update flows, preserving provider-specific formatting and supporting Gemini/Qwen namespace opt-outs.

### 🧪 Testing
- `NODE_OPTIONS="--localstorage-file=.jest-localstorage" npm test`

## [1.8.3] - 2025-11-15

### 🐛 Fixes
- Hardened Gemini CLI and Qwen Code CLI TOML parsing so only the inner prompt body is injected, preventing duplicated headers and keeping custom commands discoverable.

### 🧪 Testing
- `npm run lint`
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `NODE_OPTIONS="--localstorage-file=.jest-localstorage" npm test`
- `npm run build:prod`

## [1.8.2] - 2025-11-15

### ✨ Features
- Added Augment CLI and Copilot CLI providers with template support and detection during `clavix init`.
- Alphabetized IDE and CLI tool selections in the initialization wizard for easier navigation.

### 🐛 Fixes
- Fixed Gemini CLI and Qwen Code CLI template handling to avoid nested `prompt = """` blocks and ensured their commands remain discoverable.
- Restored the default namespaced layout (`.gemini/commands/clavix` and `.qwen/commands/clavix`) while offering an opt-out during initialization for flat command naming.

## [1.5.2] - 2025-11-14

### 🐛 Critical Fixes

#### Multi-Provider Support in Update Command
- **Fixed**: `clavix update` now properly updates all installed providers instead of only claude-code
  - **Root Cause**: `update.ts` was reading non-existent `config.agent` field instead of `config.providers` array
  - **Impact**: Users with OpenCode, Cursor, Droid, or Amp were not getting command updates
  - **Solution**: Refactored to iterate over all providers in `config.providers`
  - **Technical Changes**: `src/cli/commands/update.ts:52-103`

#### IDE Slash Commands Updated to v1.5.0
- **Fixed**: All provider slash command templates synchronized with v1.5.0 (7→5 questions)
  - **Affected Files**:
    - `src/templates/slash-commands/claude-code/prd.md`
    - `src/templates/slash-commands/opencode/prd.md`
    - `src/templates/slash-commands/cursor/prd.md`
    - `src/templates/slash-commands/amp/prd.md`
    - `src/templates/slash-commands/droid/prd.md`
  - **Issue**: v1.5.0 updated CLI flow (7→5 questions) but forgot to update IDE slash commands
  - **Result**: `/clavix:prd` in all IDEs now uses streamlined 5-question flow

#### Hardcoded Template Paths Fixed
- **Fixed**: Dynamic template path resolution based on provider name
  - **Before**: `path.join(__dirname, 'templates/slash-commands/claude-code')` (hardcoded)
  - **After**: `path.join(__dirname, 'templates/slash-commands', adapter.name)` (dynamic)
  - **Impact**: Enables true multi-provider template management
  - **Files Updated**:
    - `src/cli/commands/update.ts:140`
    - `src/cli/commands/init.ts:274`

#### Added Special Handling for Universal Formats
- **Added**: Dedicated update methods for `agents-md` and `octo-md` providers
  - These are not standard adapters and require special handling
  - New methods: `updateAgentsMd()` and `updateOctoMd()`

### 📊 What This Fixes

**Before 1.5.2:**
```bash
clavix update --commands-only
# Only updated .claude/commands/clavix/
# OpenCode, Cursor, etc. were ignored
# Still showed 7 questions instead of 5
```

**After 1.5.2:**
```bash
clavix update --commands-only
# Updates ALL providers: claude-code, opencode, cursor, droid, amp
# All commands now use 5-question flow
# ✅ 32 files updated (4 providers × 8 commands)
```

### 🎯 Verification

All providers confirmed working with 5-question PRD flow:
- ✅ Claude Code (`/clavix:prd`)
- ✅ OpenCode (`/clavix:prd`)
- ✅ Cursor (`/clavix:prd`)
- ✅ Droid CLI
- ✅ Amp

## [1.5.1] - 2025-11-14

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Archive Detection Improvements
- **Enhanced PRD File Detection**: Extended support for multiple naming conventions in archive detection
  - Now recognizes: `FULL_PRD.md`, `QUICK_PRD.md`, `FULL-PRD.md` (uppercase and hyphenated variants)
  - Previously only detected: `PRD.md`, `full-prd.md`, `prd.md`, `Full-PRD.md`
- **Resolved Issue**: Manually archived projects with non-standard PRD filenames now appear in `clavix archive --list`
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Updated `possibleFiles` array in `src/core/archive-manager.ts:328`
  - Updated `possibleFiles` array in `src/core/task-manager.ts:611`
  - Both detection methods now consistently support all naming variants

**Impact**: Projects archived manually (e.g., via `clavix archive project-name`) that use uppercase or alternative naming conventions are now properly detected and listed.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-14

### 🚀 Major Features

#### Vibecoding-Optimized PRD Generation
- **Streamlined Questions**: Reduced from 8 questions to 5 focused questions for faster workflow
- **Smart Tech Detection**: Auto-detects tech stack from project files (package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, go.mod, Cargo.toml, composer.json)
- **CLEAR Framework Integration**: Questions designed with CLEAR principles (Concise, Logical, Explicit)
- **Maintained Quality**: All essential information captured without ceremony

### 🎯 New PRD Question Structure

**5 Focused Questions:**
1. 🎯 **Problem & Goal** (Required) - What are we building and why?
2. ⚡ **Core Features** (Required) - Must-have functionality (3-5 features)
3. 🔧 **Tech Stack** (Smart/Optional) - Auto-detected or manual input
4. 🚫 **Out of Scope** (Required) - Explicit boundaries
5. 💡 **Additional Context** (Optional) - Bonus information

**Removed Questions:**
- ❌ Target users - Unnecessary for personal projects and vibecoding
- ❌ Success metrics - Too "corporate" for fast iteration
- ❌ Deadlines/milestones - Not applicable for AI-driven development

### ✨ Smart Tech Stack Detection

**Automatic Detection:**
- Scans common config files in project root
- Detects frameworks from package.json dependencies (React, Vue, Next.js, Astro, etc.)
- Supports Python (Django, Flask, FastAPI), Ruby (Rails), Go, Rust, PHP (Laravel, Symfony)
- Shows detected stack with option to press Enter to accept or type to override
- Gracefully skips if extending existing project

**User Experience:**
```
🔧 Tech stack and requirements?
  Detected: TypeScript, Astro, Tailwind CSS (press Enter to use, or type to override)
```

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

**PRD Generator:**
- Added `detectProjectTechStack()` method in `prd.ts` for intelligent stack detection
- Updated question mapping: q1 → problem, q2 → features, q3 → technical, q4 → outOfScope, q5 → additional
- Enhanced question flow with conditional smart detection for Q3
- Auto-populates Q3 with detected stack if user presses Enter

**Templates:**
- Updated `prd-questions.md` with 5 streamlined questions and emoji indicators
- Simplified `full-prd-template.hbs` - removed users, success, timeline sections
- Optimized `quick-prd-template.hbs` for vibecoding workflow
- Updated acceptance criteria to reflect new structure

**Documentation:**
- Updated `.claude/commands/clavix/prd.md` slash command description
- Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` with vibecoding-optimized workflow details
- Updated `README.md` features and command descriptions

### 📊 Impact

**Time Savings:**
- ~40% reduction in question count (8 → 5 questions)
- Smart defaults for tech stack reduce manual input
- Optional questions can be skipped entirely

**Quality Maintained:**
- CLEAR validation still applies (C, L, E components)
- All essential project context captured
- Out-of-scope boundaries remain required for clarity

### 🎨 UX Enhancements

- Emoji indicators for each question type
- Clear "(Required)" vs "(Optional)" labels
- Helpful inline hints (e.g., "press Enter to skip if extending existing project")
- Color-coded detected tech stack display

### 📝 Migration Notes

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing PRD templates continue to work
- Custom templates in `.clavix/templates/` still supported
- CLEAR validation unchanged (C, L, E only for PRDs)

**New Behavior:**
- Q3 (tech stack) now auto-detects from project files
- Users can press Enter to skip optional questions
- Generated PRDs have simpler section structure

### 📝 What Was Fixed
- Added `plan.md` to all 5 provider template directories
- Added `implement.md` to all 5 provider template directories
- Verified frontmatter compatibility with Droid and OpenCode YAML requirements
- All providers now have feature parity with Claude Code

### ✅ Complete Command List (All Providers)
